Description: Classic knapsack problem is solved with 3 approaches to get to most optimum solution with decreasing complexity    The brute force algorithm check every possible combination before deciding on most optimum solution.    DP reduces the problem complexity to nW by dynamically checking solution values for every knapsack object.    Greedy Heuristic approach ranks objects by per unit value by object and takes objects by parts to fully utilize knapsack capacity
